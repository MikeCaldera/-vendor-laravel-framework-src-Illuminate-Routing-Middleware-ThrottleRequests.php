To achieve effective rate limiting, it is generally recommended to use a combination of both firewall-level rate limiting and application-level rate limiting. Each approach has its own benefits and considerations:

    Firewall-Level Rate Limiting: Watch for updates using psSense!

    Network-wide control: Firewall-level rate limiting allows you to control and manage traffic at the network perimeter, ensuring that rate limits are applied to all incoming or outgoing traffic.
    Protection against DoS attacks: Firewall rate limiting can provide protection against volumetric DDoS attacks by limiting the number of connections or requests per second from specific IP addresses or subnets.
    Prevents resource exhaustion: Firewall rate limiting can prevent resource exhaustion on your network or services by limiting the bandwidth, connections, or packets per second.

    Application-Level Rate Limiting: This is exactly what we are doing. Actually you should have both.

    Granular control: Application-level rate limiting allows you to have fine-grained control over rate limits for specific endpoints, APIs, or functionalities within your web application.
    Protection against application-specific attacks: Application-level rate limiting can protect against attacks like brute-force login attempts, API abuse, or excessive requests targeting specific application components.
    Customization and flexibility: Application-level rate limiting gives you the flexibility to define rate limits based on the specific requirements and behaviors of your application.

Using both firewall-level and application-level rate limiting provides a layered defense strategy, offering complementary protections at different levels of the network stack. 
This approach helps to mitigate various types of attacks and ensures that rate limits are applied both at the network perimeter and within the application itself.

By implementing rate limiting at the firewall level, you can provide a first line of defense to protect your network and services from DoS attacks and limit the impact of abusive traffic. 
Application-level rate limiting adds an additional layer of protection by enforcing rate limits specific to your application's endpoints or functionalities.

It is important to strike the right balance between the two approaches, considering the needs of your network, the sensitivity of your application, and the desired level of control and protection.
Regular monitoring, tuning, and adjusting of rate limiting settings in both the firewall and application can help maintain optimal performance and security.
